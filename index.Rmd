## About
<br/>

Iâ€™m Gordon. I studied Math in college and discovered Data Science through Numerical Analysis. This is my space for documenting my projects in Data Science and other areas. You can contact me at `gfleetwood@protonmail.com`. Here are some pertinent links.

## Selected Projects
<br/>

### Data Science
<br/>

**Data Science Crib Sheet**: [[Blog]]((https://gfleetwood.github.io/ds-crib-sheet/))

Description: A personal theoretical and practical reference for various Data Science operations.

**Pass Prediction In Soccer**: [[Blog]](https://medium.com/@gorafle/predicting-pass-recipients-in-soccer-a3acf0fa2652) | [[Code]](https://github.com/gfleetwood/pass-prediction)

Description: Analysis of data for the [Football Pass Prediction Challenge of the 5th Workshop on Machine Learning and Data Mining for Sports Analytics](https://github.com/JanVanHaaren/mlsa18-pass-prediction). It consisted of mostly of player location data for over 12,000 passes from Belgian soccer. The stated goal was to predict the recipient of a pass.

Summary: The main pipeline involved feature engineering to create a feature for distance, another for the product of x-y coordinates, scaling numeric features, and dummying the sole categorical column. A 5-fold cross validated untuned Logistic Regression model with a 23% accuracy score compared to a naive baseline of 5.6%.
<br/>

**Classifying Hate Speech**: [[Blog]](https://www.opendatascience.com/blog/identifying-hate-speech/) | [[Code]](https://github.com/gfleetwood/crowd-flower-hate-speech)

Description: Identifying hate speech is an important task on the internet. I used scikit-learn and the nltk package to build a hate speech classifier using Twitter data from CrowdFlower.

Summary: The final model utilized the Random Forest Classifier and achieved 76% accuracy on unseen data, a 26% increase over the baseline accuracy of 50%. I productionized the model as an app which allows a user to submit text to be classified. The app is no longer currently deployed.
<br/>

Analyzing Kickstarter Data: [[Blog]](http://blog.nycdatascience.com/students-work/scraping-kickstarter/) | [[Code]](https://github.com/gfleetwood/nyc-data-science-academy/tree/master/scraping_kickstarter)

Description: Kickstarter is the foremost platform for crowd-sourced projects on the internet. I scraped data from the site and used R's caret library to predict whether or not a project will be funded. 

Summary: The final model was an ensemble of a Logistic Regression classifier built on numerical features and a Random Forest model built from text features. It achieved close to 83% accuracy on unseen data compared to a baseline of 60%.
<br/>

**An Introduction To Principal Component Analysis**: [[Code]](https://github.com/gfleetwood/pca_presentation)

Description: A talk given at the New York Data Science Study Group's [meeting for August](http://www.meetup.com/NYC-Data-Science-Study-Group/events/227860773/). In the presentation I went through the algorithm's mathematical foundations, and then
moved through three increasing complex examples of its use. The repository also contains a link to a [binder](http://mybinder.org/) for interactive exploration of the material.
<br/>

**handyman**: [[Code]](https://github.com/gfleetwood/handyman)

**Description**: A collection of personal Python Data Science scripts.

**ofziermessr**: [[Code]](https://github.com/gfleetwood/ofziermessr)

**Description**: A collection of personal R Data Science scripts. The name is a bastardization of the German word for Swiss Army knife.

**sansor**: [[Code]](https://github.com/gfleetwood/sansor)

**Description**: An R wrapper over several command line utilities for Data Science.
<br/>

### Software
<br/>

**ODSC Meetup Map**: [[App]](https://gfleetwood.shinyapps.io/odsc_meetup_map/)[[Code]](https://github.com/OpenDataScienceConference/meetup-map)

**Description**: An interactive app made in R which shows the Open Data Science Conference's (ODSC) meetups around the world. Data is scraped from the Meetup.com using rvest, and displayed as a map via the leaflet library. The flexdashboard library provides the layout.
