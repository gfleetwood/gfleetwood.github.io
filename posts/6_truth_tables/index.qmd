Recently I wanted to compare two truth tables. After some frustrating googling for a simple site to use, I decided to try Python. It was easy:

```
from itertools import product
from pandas import DataFrame
 
exp = lambda a, b, c, d, e: a and b or c and d and e
exp2 = lambda a, b, c, d, e: a and (b or c) and d and e
 
def exp3(a, b, c, d, e): 
 
  result = a and b or c and d and e
  truth_table = {"a": a, "b": b, "c": c, "d": d, "e": e, "a & b | c & d & e": result}
 
  return(truth_table)
 
arr = [False, True]
cartesian_product = list(product(arr, arr, arr, arr, arr))
 
#for a,b in zip(list(map(lambda x: exp(*x), cartesian_product)), list(map(lambda x: exp2(*x), cartesian_product))):
#  print(a == b)
 
truth_table = list(map(lambda x: exp3(*x), cartesian_product))
truth_table_df = DataFrame(truth_table)
 
truth_table_df
```
