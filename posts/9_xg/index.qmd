Expected Goals is the premier stat in the world of soccer analytics. After struggling to make the jump from research to the media, it's now a staple statistics in every broadcast.

But the some of the early pushback still remains, and it's often quoted as
 an afterthought and without much comprehension. I thought a good idea would be to incorporate it into highlights to reinforce what it means.
 
The table below is the first five rows xG data from Burnley x Man City in the 2023-24 season.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}
knitr::kable(readr::read_csv("xg.csv")[1:5,])
```


See the still images resulting from my poor video editing.

I also made a couple of plots of to explore how to represent xG data. This is from fake data I generated.

Finally, I made a game! It's just a demo. It asks the player to watch a goal and guess what the xG of the shot was. The player's score is determined by the Brier score. Unfortunately, I can't keep it deploy right now, but here's the code if you want to deploy and play it:
